abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Photo-induced transition probabilities in graphene are studied theoretically from the viewpoint of Floquet theory. Conduction band populations are computed for a strongly, periodically driven graphene sheet under linear, circular, and elliptic polarization. Features of the momentum spectrum of excited quasi-particles can be directly related to the avoided crossing of the Floquet quasi-energy levels. In particular, the impact of the ellipticity and the strength of the laser excitation on the avoided crossing structure - and on the resulting transition probabilities - is studied. It is shown that the ellipticity provides an additional control parameter over the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling in graphene, allowing one to selectively suppress multiphoton resonances.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. This Letter demonstrates control over multiphoton absorption processes in driven two-level systems, which include, for example, superconducting qubits or laser-irradiated graphene, through spectral shaping of the driving pulse. Starting from calculations based on Floquet theory, we use differential evolution, a general purpose optimization algorithm, to find the Fourier coefficients of the driving function that suppress a given multiphoton resonance in the strong field regime. We show that the suppression of the transition probability is due to the coherent superposition of high-order Fourier harmonics which closes the dynamical gap between the Floquet states of the two-level system.},

abstract = {The Stratton-Chu integral representation of electromagnetic fields is used to study the spatio-temporal properties of large bandwidth laser pulses focused by high numerical aperture mirrors. We review the formal aspects of the derivation of diffraction integrals from the Stratton-Chu representation and discuss the use of the Hadamard finite part in the derivation of the physical optics approximation. By analyzing the formulation we show that, for the specific case of a parabolic mirror, the integrands involved in the description of the reflected field near the focal spot do not possess the strong oscillations characteristic of diffraction integrals. Consequently, the integrals can be evaluated with simple and efficient quadrature methods rather than with specialized, more costly approaches. We report on the development of an efficiently parallelized algorithm that evaluates the Stratton-Chu diffraction integrals for incident fields of arbitrary temporal and spatial dependence. We use our method to show that the reflection of a linearly polarized Gaussian beam of femtosecond duration off a high numerical aperture parabolic mirror induces ellipticity in the dominant field components and generates strong longitudinal components. We also estimate the intensities that may be reached at the future high-power laser facility APOLLON.},

abstract = {Self-assembled GaN microdisks, micro- and nanorods were grown by a mask-free and self-catalyzed metal- organic vapor phase epitaxy method. The morphology of the structures is analyzed by scanning electron mi- croscopy. All rods have a hexagonal shape with smooth sidewall facets and sharp edges. Depending on the de- position of a GaN nucleation layer prior to growth of GaN rod structures the diameter of the rods can be ad- justed. Nanorods with diameters down to 400nm as well as microrods and disks with diameters up to 5 µm can be achieved. The optical properties of the rods are investi- gated utilizing a combined scanning electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence system. Electron beam exciti- ation of GaN rods leads to a typical GaN spectrum show- ing GaN near band edge emission at 369nm and broad yellow defect luminescence at 560 nm. Enhanced emis- sion is located at the top of the rod. By fixing the fo- cussed electron beam at a sidewall position of a single GaN rod, whispering gallery modes are observed in the cathodoluminescence spectrum. Depending on the diam- eter of the micro-/nanorods the spectral position of the modes as well as the spectral distance between the modes can be adjusted. Quality factors up to 475 are measured. 1},

The proposed designs allow not only for logical polarization filtering, but can also be tailored to output an arbitrary transverse beam profile. The lattice configurations are found using a recently proposed parallel tabu search algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems in integrated photonics.},

We find that the order in which modes lase can be modified by choosing suitable combinations of the gain center frequency and linewidth, a result that cannot be obtained using the conventional approach of quasi-bound modes.

abstract = {A large body of work has accumulated over the years in the study of the optical properties of single and coupled microcavities for a variety of applications, ranging from filters to sensors and lasers. The focus has been mostly on the geometry of individual resonators and/or on their combination in arrangements often referred to as photonic molecules (PMs). Our primary concern will be the lasing properties of PMs as ideal candidates for the fabrication of integrated microlasers, photonic molecule lasers. Whereas most calculations on PM lasers have been based on cold-cavity (passive) modes, i.e. quasi-bound states, a recently formulated steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) offers the possibility to take into account the spectral properties of the underlying gain transition, its position and linewidth, as well as incorporating an arbitrary pump profile. We will combine two theoretical approaches to characterize the lasing properties of PM lasers: for two-dimensional systems, the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory will obtain the resonant modes of the coupled molecules in an active medium described by SALT. Not only is then the theoretical description more complete, the use of an active medium provides additional parameters to control, engineer and harness the lasing properties of PM lasers for ultra-low threshold and directional single-mode emission.},
